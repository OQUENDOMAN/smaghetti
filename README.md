## Try it

It is available here: https://smaghetti.com

## Status

Very early. The editor itself was from a previous project and is pretty mature. But there is still a lot of work to do reverse engineering the game and adding missing features.

If really curious where things are at or what's next, check out the [trello board](https://trello.com/b/SKzcVqgT/smaghetti)

## Editor quick start

The editor is at https://smaghetti.com/make

It is very user friendly and takes loose inspiration from Nintendo's Mario Maker. 

Proper documentation and tutorial videos will come later, but for now some features that are less obvious:

* keyboard shortcuts, all the toolbar buttons show their shortcut in their tooltip. Also you can focus certain entities in the palete on the left side using numbers 1 through 9. ctrl/cmnd-z undoes, and ctrl/cmnd-shift-z redoes.
* Hold the space bar then click and drag on the canvas to pan it around
* Use your mouse's scrollwheel to zoom in and out
* drag and select entities, then move them.
* select a single entity to edit details about it. Only some entities support this, try the question block.
