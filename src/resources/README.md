These are graphical assets that need to be extracted from the SMA4 rom, but they only serve as graphics, they don't become full fledged sprites or objects.

These are mostly used for payloads inside of objects, for example CoinCache is the payload where if you hit the brick multiple times you get multiple coins. That concept doesn't exist beyond being a payload.
